Here is where i am for now, if you already have a base we also can go with that, as you like!

Here the pipes need a little debug, i will fix that soon. But i wanted to push today so you can see the started work.

For the work repartition, i thought about working on parsing, variables, pipes and redirection and i thougt maybe you would like to work on the bultins, the history and the signals? Again this is only a first proposition, we can do as you like :)



Currently working
1. simple command execution (ls, cat, grep) - as long as command is given exact; no detail parsing needed
2. echo - simple; without option and detail parsing 
3. env
4. pwd
